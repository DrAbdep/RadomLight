# RadomLight
JS code for Node.Red to slightly randomize the lights in the room.

The image shows how to set up the flow for the function. 

The function needs to have outputs for every light/light group it is about to work with.

In the future i will be working on adding a random slight change in the brightness/color over time to create an illusion of a live light (candle etc.)
